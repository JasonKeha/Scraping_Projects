# Scraping_Projects
This is a repository showcasing my most important web scraping projects.

Specifically in this repository I show how I am:

* Proficient in identifying and handling web page structures.
* Skilled in using web scraping libraries to extract data from websites.
* Experienced in cleaning and transforming scraped data to ensure quality and consistency.
* Able to communicate insights and findings effectively through visualizations and/or reports.
* Capable of saving the scraped insights to a csv file

And when it comes to python libraries I show my ability in the following:

* Beautiful Soup: a library for parsing HTML and XML documents and extracting data from them.
* Requests: a library for making HTTP requests to websites and retrieving data from them.
* Pandas: a library for data manipulation and analysis.
* Plotly: a library for creating interactive visualizations, such as maps and 3D plots.
* CSV: a library for reading and writing data to CSV files.
* Writer: a library for writing data to CSV files.
